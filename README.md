## Synopsis

This is the Neighborhood Map project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree. My app keeps track of some of my favorite places to eat in Orange, CA. The food spot markers show the hours of operation and can be filtered by type.

This app uses the Google Maps API and the [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) API

## Run
To run locally:

Download the project and open "index.html" in your browser.

The Google Maps API will load a fullscreen map with my location markers. Clicking on a marker will display an info window with the food spot's name and weekly hours of operation. Clicking on the list to the left will also display the name and hours. The drop down menu above the list on the left provides a way to filter the list and markers by type. When an option is selected, the list and map will update to only show locations of that type.

The sidebar can be collapsed by clicking the hamburger icon.
